*INTRODUCTION

A simple fetching from Rick and morty API using axios. I used React for the app and Javascript for logics.

*REQUERIMENTS.

-Create React App. -NPM commands for use the app(NO YARN).

*INSTALLATION

I personally recommend use a git clone from the repository for take the app.

but if you wnat install the react app by your self there is their own documentation. https://create-react-app.dev/

*CONFIGURATION

NPM start for run the app.
NPM build for install the requeriments of the jsons.

*DEPLOYMENT

One of most intersting things: I´ts deployed by vercel, I recomend their documentation for do it.

I invite you to do a code review to improve and add good practices. I hope you like it and that if you do a similar project that you enjoy the process. Greetings and thank you for your time.
